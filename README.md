# Project: Music Genre Classification

## Project Description
With the increasing popularity of music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music year over year, innovative implementations of audio-based machine learning algorithms have been underscored as essential components of the music streaming market. Spotify and other music streaming companies have implemented machine learning in a variety of areas within their services, ranging from song recommendations based on prior listening preferences to smart artist suggestions based on similar listener data. Given the wide range of practical applications for audio-based machine learning algorithms, for our project, we decided to focus on developing a model that would use song genres to draw insights and connections between songs to enhance the user experience. 

For our project, we are training a machine learning model to classify music into various genres based on audio features such as tempo, pitch, and rhythm. Users will be able to use this model’s assistance to identify the genre of their music choice quickly and efficiently. The users will be Spotify listeners and song enthusiasts. 

Our project will utilize two different algorithms at different stages of development. In the early stages of development, we will use a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to develop our model’s parameters based on smaller datasets, develop a baseline for accurate classifications, and to evaluate and enhance the feature extraction process. After achieving sufficient results from smaller datasets using the K-Nearest Neighbor approach, we will subsequently apply our learnings from small to large datasets using a recurrent neural network approach. With this convolutional neural network, we plan to enhance performance accuracy based on raw data, optimize identification speed for large datasets, capture complex dependencies in data, and derive insights about the defining traits of certain genres based on model identification.

With this machine learning model, we aim to allow users to explore similar songs or playlists based on their music choices and provide users with related music recommendations that closely adhere to their genre-specific listening preferences. We hope that employing this model will enhance the user experience and lead to the creation of brand new connections between users and songs based on genre.
